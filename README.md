# Comparing Cupertino and Baltimore's Incarceration Rate Depending on Income and Percent Non-White Population
## Background
In my last project, I looked at Cupertino and Baltimore's incarceration rate in relation to income level and found correlations in the data. In my conclusion, I considered that there may be other variables at play that could be impacting the incarceration rate so I decided to bring in percent non-white as an additional variable to see if this factor will impact the incarceration rate. I am using similar data to see whether income and percent non-white population can predict the incarceration rate in both cities. It could be entirely possible that percent non-white is significant for one city and not for the other.

## Business Question
Can the incarceration rate in Cupertino and Baltimore be predicted by both household income and percent non-white population?

## Data
 - All datasets used were from [Opportunity Atlas](https://www.opportunityatlas.org/) and are in the repository above with the calculated datasets used as well.
  - [Baltimore Dataset](https://github.com/angelali1479/incarceration-rate-dependence-on-income-and-percent-nonwhite/blob/main/baltimore%20data%20final.xlsx)
  - [Cupertino Dataset](https://github.com/angelali1479/incarceration-rate-dependence-on-income-and-percent-nonwhite/blob/main/cupertino%20data%20final.xlsx)

## Data Analysis
In order to determine whether the two independent variables chosen are actually able to predict incarceration rate, we need to look at a multiple linear regression analysis of both city's datasets.
