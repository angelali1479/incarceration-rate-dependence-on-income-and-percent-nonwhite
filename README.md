# Comparing Cupertino and Baltimore's Incarceration Rate Depending on Income and Percent Non-White Population
## Background
In my last project, I looked at Cupertino and Baltimore's incarceration rate in relation to income level and found correlations in the data. In my conclusion, I considered that there may be other variables at play that could be impacting the incarceration rate so I decided to bring in percent non-white as an additional variable to see if this factor will impact the incarceration rate. I am using similar data to see whether income and percent non-white population can predict the incarceration rate in both cities. It could be entirely possible that percent non-white is significant for one city and not for the other.
## Business Question
Can the incarceration rate in Cupertino and Baltimore be predicted by both household income and percent non-white population?
